    <div id="header"> 
        <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 10%;">Ali Wong</h2>
        <h1 style="text-align: center; line-height: 50%;">Baby Cobra</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Data Visualizations</h3>
        <p>In the following dashboard, I created three Visualizations regarding Ali Wong's stand up comedy Netflix special "Baby Cobra".</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <div id="map" class="center_plot">
    </div>

    <p>That's a lot of states! Let's take a deeper dive into Ali Wong's Baby Cobra script. What makes it so popular? 
        <br> In the following visualization, I graphed each segment of the show (based on its topic) based on their time, and show the number of laughters that she got for each topic.
        <br> There are some topics that received 0 laughs. For clarity, when your mouse move over to where they are, a tooltip will show and display which topic it was.
    </p>
        
    </div>
        <div id="bar_chart" class="center_plot">
    </div>

    <p>
        Now let's explore further in what makes these topics so funny. 
        <br>I encoded a couple over-arching themes that repeats throughout the show. 
        <br>I hand-collected data on each topic that Ali Wong talked about, their corresponding theme, and the references they make to each other. 
        <br>They are shown in this graph - that's a lot of references!
        <br>
        <br> You can also notice that a lot of the earliers topics are called back in the end, and that the end contains even more references to the beginning of the show.
        <br> What makes Ali Wong's Baby Cobra so funny is truly the callbacks.
